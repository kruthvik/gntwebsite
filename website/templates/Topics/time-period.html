<p align="center" class="c2 title dbl" id="h.lq3gikty2s24"><span align="center" class="c0">&emsp;Pablo Picasso is an influential artist, probably the most renowned of his time. He both influenced and was influenced by his time. There were a plethora of artistic movements throughout Picasso&rsquo;s life that influenced him. </span>
</p>
<p class="c2 title dbl" id="h.824p2cejzqri"><span class="c1">&emsp;The artistic movement during Picasso&rsquo;s childhood was realism. During this period, realistic art was much more common, and often, featured life-like details and depictions. Picasso had influenced the art in this period drastically, with his simple abstract art, made from cubism. He had invented cubism and started the Cubist movement in the early 1900s. Cubism is as its name suggests, art-based around cubes. His art pieces based on Cubism have been deeply criticized sometimes good and bad. For example, one of Picasso&rsquo;s most famous art pieces is Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon. This art piece was deeply inspired by an African style of painting and has been deeply criticized for its &ldquo;mistreatment of the female body&rdquo; and has been deemed immoral. Another art movement in his childhood was the more modern post-impressionist movement. This art style was of French origin and housed many famous artworks including &ldquo;The Scream&rdquo; by Edvard Munch. This movement, though, was much less popular compared to realism. This hasn&rsquo;t affected Picasso&rsquo;s artwork much though. Surrealism emerged from realism and was around most of Picasso&rsquo;s later life. Its movement deeply influenced many artists including Salvador Dali. Abstract expressionism came around this time. This movement was much more common in sculpting than in painters and artists like Picasso. But, Picasso has worked in almost all these art forms. He has worked deeply in realism and surrealism. One of his earliest artworks made when he was 16, &ldquo;Science and Charity&rdquo; is an early example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
