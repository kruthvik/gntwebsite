Picasso is an extremely vague and mysterious artist. His art has been sold for millions of dollars and he
would even be the richest artist were he alive right now. As a young child, he was into art. He was so good
that his father quit art when he was 13 for surpassing his skills. From the young age of 7, he took formal
art classes from his dad. His family moved to La Coruna in 1892, and just after a year, Picasso was accepted
into the school of Fine and Applied Arts. He lived a very depressing childhood as his sister died when he
was just 14. He was influenced by many artists during his early ages of arts. He had dyslexia, a learning
disorder. This deeply affected his artworks as he usually painted what he saw. He invented the art from
cubism while working on the deeply criticized &#39;Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon&#39; based on an African
style of painting. This would later affect his other artworks and influence the art at the time overall.
Towards his later life, he worked on surrealism. His artwork had many different styles of painting. Picasso
was also involved with numerous women who were just as interested in art as him. He lived in Spain for most of his life and experimented with style to style. He
was not only an artist but also a sculpture. Picasso revolutionized art as we know it today.</span>
